## Commit messages
messaginghub-client-js uses `semantic-release` and conventional commits in order to correctly publish new versions of the package. Make sure to use `commitizen` configured with the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter to properly format your commit messages or use our predefined npm script for commits:

```
npm run commit
```
